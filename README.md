# Algorithms Collection in Kotlin (and More to Come!)

Welcome to the **Algorithms Collection** repository! This is a growing library of algorithm implementations written in **Kotlin**, with plans to expand to other programming languages in the future, including:

- **Dart**
- **Go**
- **Python**
- **Rust**

## About the Repository
This repository is designed to:
- Provide clean and well-documented implementations of common algorithms.
- Serve as a learning resource for developers interested in algorithmic problem-solving.
- Offer solutions in multiple programming languages to help developers compare and learn different paradigms and styles.

Currently, the focus is on algorithms implemented in Kotlin, but as the project evolves, equivalent implementations in other languages will be added.

## Algorithms Covered
The repository includes a variety of algorithms, including but not limited to:
- **Search Algorithms**:
  - Binary Search
  - Recursive Binary Search
  - Linear Search
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort (upcoming)
- **Other Common Algorithms**:
  - (Planned for future releases)

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- Each programming language will have its own directory.
- Within each directory, algorithms are grouped by category (e.g., `search`, `sorting`, `graph`, etc.).

Example structure:
```
algorithms/
  kotlin/
    search/
      binarySearch.kt
      linearSearch.kt
    sorting/
      mergeSort.kt
  dart/
    (future additions)
  go/
    (future additions)
  python/
    (future additions)
  rust/
    (future additions)
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to:
- Add a new algorithm.
- Port existing algorithms to a different language.
- Improve documentation or code quality.

Please feel free to open a pull request or issue.

## Future Plans
- Add more algorithms in Kotlin.
- Expand the repository to include implementations in Dart, Go, Python, and Rust.
- Write test cases for each algorithm.
- Provide detailed explanations and analysis of each algorithm.
